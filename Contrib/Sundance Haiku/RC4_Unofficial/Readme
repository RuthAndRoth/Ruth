To make files a bit easier to find, I've added a "RC4_Unofficial" directory.
This is work that I've done after the RC3 release that might have some
possibilities for the next Ruth release.

Ada Radius had posted a note on the Ruth MeWe community site and asked about
RC3 work on the feet.  I had done extensive work on the UV's of both the flat
and high feet, as well as some work on lower part of the body.  I hadn't
quite finished when Shin was ready to release RC3.  For the RC3 release,
Shin used my Version 15 file.   I finished up my changes to the UV's in a
Version 16.  These weren't included in the RC3 release, but I wanted to make
them available if it would be helpful at some future time.  The full name of
the Version 16 file is: Release3_AdaShinEdit_SundanceEdit_16.blend and is
found in the following GitHub directory:
RuthAndRoth\Contrib\Sundance Haiku\RC4_Unofficial.

Some time after the RC3 release, I had done some work on the alphas.  At
least one creator had explained that it would be helpful to be able to
select alphas either on the right or left in the pelvic area.   RC3 and
previous releases did not have that flexibility because the alphas on the
right and left sides were linked together.  I re-worked the alphas in this
area to provide that flexibility.  I also added a bit more flexibility in
the breast area.  The overall alpha arrangement stays pretty much the same
so that most clothing created in past versions would compatible with the
newer alpha arrangement.  The name of this file in which I did the new alpha
arrangement is: ShinRC3_SundanceNewAlphas.blend and is found in the following
GitHub directory: RuthAndRoth\Contrib\Sundance Haiku\RC4_Unofficial

Since at the time I did this work, RC3 was the official release, I made the
changes to the RC3 source file.  I did, however, include the changes I made
in version 16.  Shin's RC3 source file is found in the previous Ruth GitHub
site under the the following directory:
Ruth\Mesh\Avatar Ruth\Current Release\OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_Source_RC3.blend.

I've also re-worked the Alpha HUD so that it works with the new alpha
arrangement described above and will post it when I'm able to free up some
time.

All Good Things,

Sundance
