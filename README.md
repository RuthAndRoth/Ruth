# Ruth and Roth 2.0 Mesh Avatar Project

Ruth and Roth 2.0 are low-poly mesh bodies, specifically designed for OpenSimulator. They are built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the OpenSimulator Community.

## Current Release

The Ruth/Roth 2.0 current release files have been kept in a number of
'Current Release' directories before now.  We have renamed these
directories to 'Release' as there is no longer a need to distinguish which
release they belong to.

## Previous Release

The Ruth 2.0 RC2 release files have been kept in a number of 'Previous Release'
directories in the repo.  These have been archived into a git branch named
'archive-rc2' and the directories renamed 'Release' in that branch.  These
'Previous Release' directories will be removed from the master branch in the
near future.
