## RC2 Archive Branch

This is a branch of the active development of the Ruth repo as of Shin's last
commit on 11 Nov 2018 in order to preserve the state of the project.  The
'Current Release' directories have been removed as they contain RC3 files at
this point.  Other RC3 bits are most likely still present and may or may not
be cleaned up in this branch in the future.

## Previous Release

The Ruth 2.0 RC2 release files have been kept in a number of 'Previous Release'
directories in the repo.  These have been renamed to 'Release' to indicate
they are the current files for this branch.  This is a bit of a retcon to
make the structure consistent with the ongoing development, but is the only
change made to the RC2 files.
