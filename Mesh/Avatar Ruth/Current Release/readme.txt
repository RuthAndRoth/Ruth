OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_DevKit_RC3.blend - This blender file is intended for content creators. It is an exact duplicate of the source file but textured with the alpha cut faces used for the official RC#3 release. I usually join the parts as a personal preference but I am leaving that up to each content creator's preference.
